I am a Software developer who has a high level of passion for technology. Driven by my goals, I am open and capable of learning new technologies on the job because of my experience with a wide range of technologies. I began learning how to code during my time studying computer science at undergraduate level with The Standard HTML, CSS, Javascript. Software development has been a career path I have become very passionate about, so I bring enthusiasm and commitment to learning that comes with dedicating yourself to a goal.
